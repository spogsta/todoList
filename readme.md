a simple to do list
the project list currently just scrools between projects 0-x (x being whatever you create)
todo's go inside of the project, create todos with a modal. but not projects? 

it's a skeleton right now, but the JS and webpack is functional, ad date module later maybe.
fix up css+html for style.


need to set project names up.
